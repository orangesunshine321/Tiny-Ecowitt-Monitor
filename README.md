## üîç How to Find Your Gateway IP Address

Before you start monitoring your plants, you'll need to find the IP address of your Ecowitt Gateway. Here's a simple guide to help you locate it:

### **Step 1: Find the MAC Address Using the Ecowitt App**

1. **Open the Ecowitt App** on your iOS device (Might be the same on Android, I don't have one to test).
2. **Tap the Three-Line Icon** in the top left corner. üì±
3. **Select "My Devices"** from the menu.
4. **Tap the Three-Dot Icon** on the right side of your Ecowitt Gateway device.
5. **Write down/copy the MAC Address** displayed. üìã

### **Step 2: Locate the IP Address**

With the MAC address in hand, you can now find the corresponding IP address:

#### **Method 1: Check Your Router's Connected Devices**

1. **Access Your Router's Admin Page**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Enter your router's IP address (commonly `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`) in the address bar.
   - Log in with your router's admin credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Connected Devices Section**:
   - Look for sections labeled **Connected Devices**, **Device List**, or **DHCP Clients**.

3. **Identify Your Ecowitt Gateway**:
   - Find the device matching the **MAC Address** you obtained.
   - Note the corresponding **IP Address** listed next to it.

#### **Method 2: Use Command Prompt (on Windows)**

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Run the `arp` Command**:
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```bash
     arp -a
     ```
   - This will display a list of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses.

3. **Identify the Ecowitt Gateway**:
   - Look for the **MAC Address** you noted earlier.
   - Note the associated **IP Address**.

**NOTE:** Your computer and Ecowitt Gateway MUST be connected to the same network for the app to work.
